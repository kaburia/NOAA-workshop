# NOAA Workshop

The primary objective is to equip national meteorological agencies with the skills to access, explore, and apply the high-resolution reanalysis dataset. A specific focus will be on understanding severe weather events, such as extreme rainfall, high winds, and temperature anomalies.<br><br>

## Focus Area 1 — Ground Observations Monitoring &amp; QC
**Core Objective**: To equip NMHS participants with tools for quality-controlling ground station
data and validating it against satellite products, enabling identification of network issues and
building confidence in observational networks.

## Focus Area 2 — Next-Gen Precipitation for Trends & Extremes
**Core Objective**: To compare next-generation precipitation datasets for historical trends,
anomalies, and extreme event performance, enabling NMHS to select optimal products for
climate monitoring and risk assessment.

###  Objectives
1. Understanding and Accessing the data in Ghana, Kenya and ZImbabwe (CBAM, ERA5, CHIRPS, TAMSAT, TAHMO and GHCNd ground stations)
2. Applying the data to Severe weather forecasting
<br>

## Understanding the data
### Ground Weather Data
1. TAHMO (Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory)
  - Provides high-resolution weather and climate data collected from a network of ground stations across Africa. <br>
  [TAHMO Website](https://tahmo.org/)

2. Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd)
  - The Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd) is an integrated database of daily climate summaries from land surface stations across the globe
  - GHCNd contains records from more than 100,000 stations in 180 countries and territories.<br>
  [NCEI Ground Stations](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily)

### Satellite Products
3. IMERG Data
     - (Precipiation data provided by NASA)
5. TAMSAT (Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data)
    - Enhances the capacity of African meteorological agencies and other organisations by providing and supporting the use of satellite-based rainfall estimates, soil moisture estimates and forecasts, and related data products.<br>
  [TAMSAT Website](https://research.reading.ac.uk/tamsat/)

5. CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data)
    - CHIRPS incorporates 0.05° resolution satellite imagery with insitu station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring. <BR>
  [CHIRPS Website](https://www.icpac.net/data-center/chirps/)

### Reanalysis Datasets

6. CBAM
    - Offers data and analytical tools for monitoring and assessing climate and environmental conditions.

7. ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) and ERA5-Land
    - Provides a comprehensive, global reanalysis of historical weather and climate data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.<br>
  [ERA5 Website](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5)

### Weather Forecasting

8. Google Forecasting 
   - An ensemble of Google's weather forecasting (GraphCast and GenCast)
   - Provides a 10 day forecast
9. CBAM Forecasting
    - This is provided by Tomorrow.io

### Requirements
- API access to TAHMO
- API Access to CBAM
- Token Access from NCEI
- Google Account
